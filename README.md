## About
It is a gothic based e-commerce website that has basic features that any online store has.
It allows us to add/delete/show/increase and decrease products in our carts, to check details of a specific product, user authentication (login and registration page) and more.

I aimed to perform the following tasks on this project:

* Create a responsive and modern UI design
* Create 3D object and add into project
* Create user authentication using Firebase
* Create search engine / sort function / dark mode
* Create a cart feature where we store our selected products using Redux
* Create a contact us section to allow users to write short questions to us
* Create a fake Check Out process where allow to us save our orders and shipping info into Firestore
* Extract the data from json and display the extracted data showing in my situation Product (name, category, description, images etc).
